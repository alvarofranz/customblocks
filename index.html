            <p>The way to create a WordPress block has changed a couple of times since they started existing. That's
                normal
                because WordPress is a natural project that grows organically. Everything changes. But don't worry. Here
                is a step by step, updated guide.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="environment">
            <h3>Step 1: Have a local environment with node installed</h3>
            <p>If you are going to develop a block, chances are you know your way around, and just want the steps to
                create a block, but <strong>already have a local environment set up and know what node and npm
                    is</strong>.</p>
            <p>If you do, go to the next step.</p>
            <p>If you don't, just keep reading.</p>
            <h4>Local WordPress environment</h4>
            <p>Don't panic. This isn't anything crazy. The point is... you need the tools to run WordPress on the
                machine you are using to develop your block. I guess that makes sense. If you can't run WordPress, you
                can't look at the block you are creating.</p>
            <p>All you need is to install Docker and Node.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Docker: Install on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/"
                                          target="_blank">Windows</a>, <a
                        href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/" target="_blank">Linux</a> or <a
                        href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/" target="_blank">macOS</a> .
                </li>
                <li>Node: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank">Install Node</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once this is done, just open a terminal. A terminal is a way to talk to your computer with commands. You
                can open a terminal as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Windows: Ctrl + Alt + T</li>
                <li>macOS: Cmd + Space, then type "terminal"</li>
                <li>Linux: You already know ;)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once it's open, you will see a window where you can type in a text. That's where you can write or
                copy/paste the following command (a command is an instruction for your computer):</p>
            <pre>npm -g i @wordpress/env</pre>
            <p>This basically means: "Hey, please install the package from npm called <i>@wordpress/env</i>".</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/install-wp-env-command.png" alt="Install wp-env command" width="791" height="536">
            </figure>
            <p>Hit intro and let it work. Once that's done, you should see something like this or very similar: </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/wp-installed.png" alt="Installed wp-env command" width="791" height="536">
            </figure>
            <p>Great news, now you can start your local environment by running:</p>
            <pre>wp-env start</pre>
            <p>You should now see something as follows:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/wp-env-start.png" alt="Start WP Env" width="791" height="536">
            </figure>
            <p>There are two instances... just open the first link, and you should see your WordPress installation up
                and running!</p>
            <p>You can now access the admin area by appending /wp-admin to the URL. The default credentials are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Username: admin</li>
                <li>Password: password</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So yeah, that's what you need to type in to login into the admin area:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/access-admin-area.png" alt="Access admin area" width="484" height="455">
            </figure>
            <p>Good to go!, you have your local WordPress environment set up. Now you can start coding plugins, themes,
                blocks, and even add cool new stuff and contribute to the community!</p>
        </section>
        <section id="create">
            <h3>Step 2: Use the create-block tool</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/create-block" target="_blank">create-block</a> tool
                is an official npm package used to create WordPress blocks.</p>
            <p>To use it just run:</p>
            <pre>npx @wordpress/create-block@latest my-custom-block</pre>
            <p>Of course, you can change <i>"my-custom-block"</i> to whatever you like. This is the name of your new
                block.</p>
            <p>If you never installed the create-block package before, it will ask you to install it. But the cool thing
                about using npx is that it will clean everything up after using it. Also, note that using <i>@latest</i>,
                ensures we will use the most up-to-date version.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/npx-create-block-command.png" alt="NPX Command" width="1059" height="199"
                     loading="lazy">
            </figure>
            <p>Just enjoy the process while it runs.</p>
            <p>What this command does is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It creates a WordPress plugin for you</li>
                <li>That plugin already contains the base for the new block</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once completed, it should say: <i>"Done: WordPress plugin My Custom Block bootstrapped in the
                my-custom-block directory"</i>. And also give you a bunch of example commands, like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>npm start</strong>: Starts the build for development.</li>
                <li><strong>npm run build</strong>: Builds the code for production.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And some others... but yeah for now, what you should do is look at the plugin that has been created
                for you, which is inside the WordPress plugins folder and has a structure as follows:</p>
            <p>You already created a custom block plugin, and can now go to your admin area to activate it.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/block-plugin-example.png" alt="Block Plugin Example" width="792" height="156"
                     loading="lazy">
            </figure>
            <p>Once activated, your block is now available in the editor. For example, you may create a new post and
                there you will see it, ready to be used!</p>
            <p>Click the "+" symbol to add a block and either browse the gallery or just type the name of the block,
                which in this case is <i>"My custom block"</i>.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/see-custom-block.png" alt="See custom block" width="362" height="298" loading="lazy">
            </figure>
            <p>When you add it to the page, you will see the block in action.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="customize">
            <h3>Step 3: Customize the block to suit your needs!</h3>
            <p>Now all you need to do is customize this block to make something amazing with it. And to do so, you have
                to understand its structure.</p>
            <p>Let's start by looking at the contents of the plugin folder:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/block-plugin-structure.png" alt="Block Plugin Structure" width="441" height="391"
                     loading="lazy">
            </figure>
            <p>There you go!</p>
